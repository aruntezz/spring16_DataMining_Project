Movie is awesome
heroine brings beauty to the movie
such a worst movie i have ever watched
Expectations were not fulfilled
Want to watch the movie one more time
once more
Direction was so good
screen play was bad
its an awkward love story
Heroin is too beautiful
The pair was not perfect
Its a perfect entertaining movie
I was so impressed by the movie
Feel good movie
we can learn values of life from the movie
father caracter was so realistic
must watch film
its a hit movie
Very very bad
Picturization was too bad
Never understood by any one
Clumsy story was not understood
Not bad
