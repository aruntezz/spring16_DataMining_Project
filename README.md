# DATA MINING
##Introduction: 
	Data mining is a technique of extraction hidden patterns from large data bases. 
#Sentiment Analysis
##Project outline: 
The outline of the project is sentiment identification system using Machine learning technique to classify the polarity of the movie review as positive, negative.
##Problem:
Problem is to find the polarities (sentiments) based on the reviews of the users, whether they are positive or negative (good or bad). 
##Data:
Data is obtained from tweets and imdb. The data in tweets is raw and contains unwanted numeric and special characters, they are removed in the code before performing the analysis.
#NAÏVE BAYES TECHNIQUE
Bayes theorem provides a way of calculating the posterior probability, P(c|x), from P(c), P(x), and P(x|c). Naive Bayes classifier assume that the effect of the value of a predictor (x) on a given class (c) is independent of the values of other predictors. This assumption is called as class conditional independence.

 Naïve Bayes rule

P(c|x)=P(x1|c)  P(x2|c) ….. P(xn|c) P(c)

•	P(c|x) is the posterior probability of class (target) given predictor(attribute).
•	P(c) is the prior probability of class.
•	P(x|c) is the likelihood which is the probability of predictor given class.
•	P(x) is the prior probability of predictor.





Naïve Bayes Conditional Independence Assumption

Assume that the probability of observing the conjunction of attributes is equal to the product of the individual probability P(Xi|Cj).
